## Inspiration

We drew inspiration from story-telling games, such as Episode, and classic mysteries/thrillers for our plotline itself, like Clue.

## What it does

Our program relies on user input to function, with the user clicking on the screen to move to the next page and make decisions which impact the course of the story. You can live 6 different lives with just the click of a button.

## How we built it and the challenges we ran into

We spent hours and hours working on the design and functionality of our program. We had a hard time building the foundation of our program, being first-time coders in Javascript, consulting mentors and different sources to determine what course to take to build our project. Once we laid the foundation, all it took was task management and time efficiency to optimize our code by using helper functions and data structures. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Our team members illustrated almost the entire storyboard, spanning 6 different paths in our interactive novel. Our finished product is comprised of these visuals and intricate designs, which we are very proud of. We are also proud of the challenges we overcame while coding in Javascript for the very first time. 

## What we learned

We learned how to work efficiently in a team, learn to use and code in a new programming language, and debug code. Given the tight deadlines, late nights, and early mornings, we had to learn to communicate, even when not at our best. We also attended three workshops, "Hackathon 101", "Data Science - Hack your way to your dream job with AI" presented by Telus, and "Intro to Git", which taught us both professional and tech skills.

## What's next for The Family Dinner

We would've loved to have time to add buttons for decisions, background music, and a full-screen gaming experience.
